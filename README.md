In 2016, I participated in NYU's [Cyber Security Awareness Week](https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/) [Capture the Flag](https://ctf.csaw.io/) event.

The following are notes for problems whose solutions are known to me:

* Notesy 2.0 - for 1 point, enter the flag given in the problem description.
* [Coinslot](coinslot.rb) - for 25 points, write a small script solving the [change-making problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem).
* [Sleeping Guard](sleeping-guard/dec.rb) - for 50 points, break the encryption on a PNG file.
* [Regexpire](regexpire.rb) - for 100 points, write a small script that can create strings that match a given regex.
* [mfw](mfw.md) - for 125 points, find and exploit a vulnerability in a PHP website.
* [Fuzyll](fuzyll) - for 200 points, follow a scavenger-hunt series style of questions regarding a one Fuzyll.
